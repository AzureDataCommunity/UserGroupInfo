# Frequently asked questions

## Group leaders

#### I lead multiple user groups. Am I limited to one group in the program?

You are not limited to a single group in the Azure Tech Groups program. However, you must submit an application for each group and they will be evaluated individually.

#### I am the primary leader for one group and the co-leader for another. Is this okay?

Yes. Many program participants hold roles in more than one user group.

#### How do I communicate leadership changes for my group?

If you or your co-leader is leaving your group, but the group would like to remain part of the Azure Tech Groups program, email azure-tech-groups@microsoft.com.
Read more about leadership changes in the [program guide](program-guide.md#leadership-changes).

#### How do I remove a group from the program?

If you would like to remove your group from the Azure Tech Groups program, you can initiate that process by emailing azure-tech-groups@microsoft.com. By withdrawing from the program, all program benefits and communications for your group will be terminated.

#### Where can I find past communications?

Past communications and quarterly call presentations can be found at [Group Leader Resources](https://azuretechcommunity.github.io/GroupLeaderResources/) on GitHub.

#### Why do we need a group code of conduct?

People are the foundation of a community. For a community to thrive, it needs diversity of thought and safety for its members. Microsoft is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion. All Microsoft employees enjoy a safe work environment and a culture of mutual respect and responsibility. Our team members and community partners should enjoy the same environment.

Read more in the [program guide](program-guide.md#code-of-conduct) or check out the [Azure Tech Groups Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

#### Do I need to reside in the same country as where my group is established?

While it's likely that most group leaders will reside in the same country or region where their group meets, this is not required to participate in the Azure Tech Groups program.

#### Is my group required to use a specific event platform?

Groups can use any major event platform to host their event pages. Custom platforms, however, may not be compliant with regional privacy requirements. To ensure the privacy and security of our community, we cannot support custom platforms.

#### What should I do if I receive an error while trying to access the Azure Tech Groups - Leaders Hub?

If you are logged in to Microsoft Tech Community and receive the following error when attempting to access the [Azure Tech Groups - Leaders Hub](https://aka.ms/azure-tech-groups/LeadersHub):
