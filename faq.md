# Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

## Group Leader Information

#### How many group leaders are required?  

You must have at least one group leader and one designated co-leader.

#### I lead multiple user groups. Am I limited to one group in the program?

You are not limited to a single group in the Azure Data Community program. However, you must submit an application for each group and they will be evaluated individually.

#### I am the primary leader for one group and the co-leader for another. Is this okay?

Yes. Many program participants hold roles in more than one user group.

#### Who needs to sign the Terms and Conditions and Code of Conduct?

Both the leader and designated co-leader must sign and accept the Terms and Conditions and agree to the Code of Conduct.

#### What if my group has a leadership change?
You may stop being the group leader, or may make leadership changes at any time by providing Microsoft with at least 14 days’ written notice, via email at ms-data@microsoft.com. In order for the Group to continue as part of the Program without suspension, the notification to Microsoft must identify the new group leader.  The new group leader must submit an application to complete all the steps by the current group leader. 

#### How do I communicate leadership changes for my group?

If you or your co-leader is leaving your group, but the group would like to remain part of the Azure Tech Groups program, email ms-data@microsoft.com.
Read more about leadership changes in the [program guide](program-guide.md#leadership-changes).

#### May I charge a fee to members?

Group leaders may not charge other members a fee to attend Group meetings, except in cases in which the venue and/or hosting costs (e.g., food and beverages) are passed through to members.

#### Do groups need to consider Microsoft Trademark & Brand guidelines?
All group must adhere to Microsoft’s Trademark and Brand guidelines, when using any Microsoft trademarks or referring to Microsoft’s software, products or services.  See guidelines.  

#### How do I remove a group from the program?

If you would like to remove your group from the Azure Data Community program, you can initiate that process by emailing ms-datas@microsoft.com. By withdrawing from the program, all program benefits and communications for your group will be terminated.

## Group Information 

#### Do we need a group code of conduct?

Yes, Groups must maintain a published code of conduct that is easily accessible from the Group’s home page. 

#### Why do we need a group code of conduct?

People are the foundation of a community. For a community to thrive, it needs diversity of thought and safety for its members. Microsoft is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion. All Microsoft employees enjoy a safe work environment and a culture of mutual respect and responsibility. Our team members and community partners should enjoy the same environment.

Unless Microsoft believes an immediate suspension is required, Microsoft will provide you reasonable notice before removing the Group from the Program.


#### Do I need to reside in the same country as where my group is established?
