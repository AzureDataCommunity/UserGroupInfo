# Azure Data Community Network program guide

## Getting started

Local user groups provide an opportunity for developers and those interested in learning new technologies to meet up with other professionals, students, and enthusiasts in their area. These groups provide an environment for networking, learning new skills, collaborating on projects, and sharing expertise. Azure Data Community User Groups connect local or virtual data platform user groups with each other, with Microsoft experts, and with the broader Azure Data technical community.

## Program benefits

As part of the Azure Data Community Network program, groups receive support, inspiration, a deeper connection to the Azure Data Community, and the following benefits:

- Quarterly Group Leader calls that allow you to connect with other Azure Data evangelists and Microsoft experts, share best practices, and learn from other community leaders.
- Access to exclusive community space for group leaders on Microsoft Tech Community.
- Early access to Azure Data-related content, such as eBooks, how to videos, best practices, code samples, and architectural guidance.
- Resources, demos and tools created by technical experts, designed to engage your group members with the latest Azure Data products and services.

### Program communications

Group leaders and co-leaders will receive regular communications from Microsoft with news, program updates and highlights, information about upcoming events, learning opportunities, and helpful resources. Each quarter, group leaders and co-leaders are invited to participate in an online call with the Microsoft team. Invitations and agendas are sent prior to each call. 

### Azure Data Community - Leaders Hub

As a leader of a group, you will have access to the [Azure Data Community - Leaders Hub](https://aka.ms/AzureDataCommunity/LeadersHub) on [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com). This is a dedicated hub where you can connect with other members of Azure Data Community groups and the Microsoft team in the **Discussions**; read about important news, updates, and features in the **Blog**; and share best practices, suggestions, and other inspiration in **Ideas**.

Group leaders and co-leaders are granted access as part of the onboarding process and can view content immediately. To participate in discussions and add the hub to your **My Hubs** menu, you must become a member.
To become a member, click **Join** on the Leaders Hub page.

### Curated content

Be one of the first people to hear about new content and initiatives from the Azure Data team. Access presentations, labs, videos, skill challenges, and other content designed for use in your user group meetings.

### Resources and tools

Whether you are hosting in-person or virtual meetups, you can find useful resources and tools to support your meetings. Check out [Azure Data Community Git Hub](https://github.com/AzureTechCommunity) to find or share content.

## Program requirements

To join the Azure Data Community Network, your group must meet the following criteria:

- Have a group leader and co-leader who will represent your group to Microsoft,
- Maintain a published Code of Conduct that is easily accessible from the group's homepage,
- Do not charge members a fee to attend group meetings, except when venue or hosting costs (e.g. food and beverages) are passed on to members,
- Maintain a regular meeting cadence and have at least six meetings per year that relate to or cover Azure Data products, features and services,
- Comply with the Azure Data Community Network [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Group leadership

Groups participating in Azure Data Community are asked to identify both a group leader and a co-leader who will act as the primary and secondary contacts for the group. This ensures that if the leadership of a group changes over time, it will not be orphaned out of the program due to lack of a valid contact.

#### Leadership changes

We understand operations and leadership of groups may change over time. If the group leader or co-leader is leaving the group, the Azure Tech Groups program team should be notified via email by the group leader at ms-data@microsoft.com to ensure group information is updated.

### Code of conduct

People are the foundation of a community. For a community to thrive, it must encourage diversity of thought and enable the safety of its members. Microsoft is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion. All Microsoft employees enjoy a safe work environment and a culture of mutual respect and responsibility. Our team members and community partners should enjoy the same environment.

Conduct issues seldom arise. But when they do, they are often very public and very passionate. It is best for the community to be prepared with:

- A clear and accessible Code of Conduct that states the norms under which projects or events operate
  - Encouraged behaviors and community guidelines
  - A list of common behaviors that are prohibited (e.g. harassment)  
- An Issue Resolution Process for addressing cases where these norms are not being maintained

A code of conduct should be displayed on your group landing page or website. If you don't currently have one, review the following examples:

- Azure Tech Groups [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
- Microsoft Tech Community [Code of Conduct](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/community-policies/code-of-conduct/ta-p/1235728)

### Fee-free experience

To lower the barrier to entry and ensure access is available to as many participants as possible, Azure Tech Groups program members should not charge an admission fee for meetings. However, certain pass-through costs are allowed (i.e. venue, beverage, and other hosting fees).

### Meeting cadence

Many groups cover a broad range of topics throughout the year. Your group should host a minimum of 6 meetups related to Azure each year. As the tech landscape evolves rapidly, we recommend that these are scheduled throughout the year so you can take advantage of the most up-to-date content for the latest releases of products and services.

## Joining the program

Admission into the Azure Tech Groups program requires a simple application process. Groups are evaluated by the program team and reviewed on a regular basis throughout the year.

## Leaving the program

If your group no longer wants to be part of Azure Tech Groups, we would like to hear from you. Group leaders should contact the Azure Tech Groups team at azure-tech-groups@microsoft.com.
