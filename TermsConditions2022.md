# Azure Data Community User Group network - Terms and Conditions

The Azure Data Community is Community Owned and Microsoft empowered. Microsoft is dedicated to empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

### Terms and Conditions for group leaders & co-leaders, agreed to upon application

### I have read the following requirements and agree to follow them.

### Acceptance of Terms

These terms and conditions (“T&Cs”) are a legal agreement between you, as the group leader (“you” or “your”) of the specific group (the “Group”) that you are applying to participate in the Azure Tech Groups program, and Microsoft (“Microsoft”, “we”, “our” or “us”).
By participating in the Microsoft Azure Data Community User Group Network program (the “Program”), you agree to be bound by these T&Cs, represent that you are 18 years or older, and have authority to bind the Group. If you do not accept these T&Cs, then you will not be allowed to participate in the Program.
Microsoft reserves the right to update these T&Cs at any time without notice to you. The most current version of the T&Cs can be reviewed by clicking on the T&Cs link.

### Description of Program
The Program connects technical user groups from across the globe and all backgrounds with resources and tools to expand their knowledge of Microsoft Data Platform technologies.

### Program Benefits

Your participation in the Program may provide you with access to certain benefits, such as early access to technical content, a channel to communicate directly with Microsoft team members, and monthly Program updates (collectively, the “Benefits”).

Some of the Benefits will require you to use your Microsoft account. The Benefits are for use by the Group as a whole, and you may only share the Benefits with members of the Group. You may not otherwise transfer, sell, share, sublicense, assign, or lend the Benefits, unless expressly indicated by Microsoft. Your access to and use of the Benefits are subject to the terms of these T&Cs and any separate license terms that accompany them, or that you are required to accept prior to accessing a Benefit. You must be a current, active member of the Program to access the Benefits.

### Privacy; Communications Policy

Your participation in the Program is subject to Microsoft’s privacy statement, which is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839.
Throughout the duration of your participation in the Program, you may receive periodic communications from Microsoft. By participating in the Program, (i) you consent to communications from Microsoft regarding your participation in the Program; (ii) you agree to make best efforts to respond promptly to communications from Microsoft that require your response; and (iii) you consent to Microsoft providing you with additional information about the Program and other Microsoft products or services. To request a copy or removal of the personal data that Microsoft has collected as part of your participation in the Program, email ms-data@microsoft.com (requests submitted only apply to data related to the Program). Removal of personal data could result in your groups’ removal from the Program.

Participation in the Program, at times, requires two-way communications. If Microsoft, at its sole discretion, believes that you are not making best efforts to respond to communications from Microsoft that require your response, then Microsoft may remove you and the Group from the Program.
If you would like to stop receiving communications from Microsoft, you may do so by electing to leave the Program at any time.

### Program Participation Requirements
Throughout the duration of the Group’s participation in the Program, the Group will:
  1.	Have a group leader and a designated co-leader who have each accepted these T&Cs.
  2.	Not charge other members a fee to attend Group meetings, except in cases in which the venue and/or hosting costs (e.g., food and beverages) are passed through to members.
  3.	Maintain a published code of conduct that is easily accessible from the Group’s home page. See guidance.
  4.	Maintain a regular meeting cadence including having meetings at least six times per year that relate to or cover Azure Data Platform products or services as laid out here.
  5.	Comply with Program’s Code of Conduct.
  6.	Adhere to Microsoft’s Trademark and Brand guidelines, when using any Microsoft trademarks or referring to Microsoft’s software, products or services (see https://www.microsoft.com/trademarks).

### Prohibited Uses

You or the Group will not use the Program:

  1.	To try to gain unauthorized access to or disrupt any Microsoft or third-party service, device, data, account or network.
  2.	To financially enrich yourself, any member of the Group, or any third party.
  3.	In a way prohibited by law, regulation, governmental order or decree.
  
### Group Removal from the Program

Failure to meet any of the Program requirements throughout the duration of the Group’s participation may result in the Group’s removal from the Program. We may also remove the Group or suspend the Group’s participation in the Program at any time if we suspect that the Group has violated any of these T&Cs. Unless Microsoft believes an immediate suspension is required, Microsoft will provide you reasonable notice before removing the Group from the Program.

### Leaving the Program

You may choose to remove the Group from the Program at any time by referencing the information on this page. If the Group leaves the Program, it will no longer receive related communications from Microsoft and no longer have access to Benefits.
Leadership Change
You may stop being the group leader, or may make leadership changes at any time by providing Microsoft with at least 14 days’ written notice, via email at ms-data@microsoft.com. In order for the Group to continue as part of the Program without suspension, the notification to Microsoft must identify the new group leader or co-leader.

### Program Termination or Suspension

We may suspend or terminate the Program at any time at our sole discretion. We will give you notice before we suspend or terminate the Program, except in cases in which we reasonably believe we need to suspend or terminate the Program immediately.

### Providing Feedback

If you or the Group gives feedback about any Microsoft software, products, services or documentation, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your or the Group’s feedback in any way and for any purpose. You or the Group will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software, products, services, or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your or the Group’s feedback in them. These rights survive the T&Cs.

### Waiver and Severability

The failure of Microsoft to exercise or enforce any rights or provisions in these T&Cs will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part or provision of these T&Cs is found to be unenforceable, such part or provision may be modified to make the T&Cs as modified legal and enforceable. The balance of the T&Cs will not be affected.

### Relationship with Microsoft

You acknowledge that your participation in the Program does not create a partnership, agency or employer-employee relationship with Microsoft or any of its suppliers. Neither you nor the Group will make any statements on behalf of Microsoft or its suppliers about Microsoft or its suppliers, or any of Microsoft’s or its suppliers’ products or services.

### Website Terms of Use

The Website Terms of Use apply to your use of the Program website including any help topics, white papers, data sheets and FAQs that are made available as part of the Program. For more details refer to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977.
